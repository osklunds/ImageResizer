## Licenses and attribution

This software uses third party libraries distributed under their own terms, see LICENSES-3RD-PARTY.txt. The third party libraries mentioned above are the following:

- Apache Commons IO: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/index.html
- metadata-extractor: https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor
- Thumbnailator: https://github.com/coobird/thumbnailator

A big THANK YOU to them! Without their software, I couldn't have made this program. 

The binary forms of them are in the `lib/` folder. The files, as they are here, has not been modified at all, with one exception: for Apache Commons IO, I have put the original `docs/` folder into a corresponding `docs.zip` file.

## The "name" ImageResizer

The program is an image resizing program. The "name" ImageResizer is more like an adjective, describing what the progam does, rather than a name of it. By this, I mean that I don't want to infringe on anyone having the rights for the name ImageResizer.
